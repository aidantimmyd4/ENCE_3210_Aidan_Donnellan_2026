# Microprocessor Lab 2 - Winter Quarter 2026
# Aidan T Donnellan
# This folder contain 4 exercises pertaining to questions in the Lab 2 handout
# File code is designed to be run in an IDE that supports C++ on an Arduino UNO R3
# Note to code comments: Google Gemini Pro was used throughout this lab and is commented in the code accordingly
# Google Gemini Pro was primarily used to piece together missing parts and help correct errors. In some cases Google Gemini Pro helped write code, and then further code was written without assistant to prior reference
# Thank you for viewing!
